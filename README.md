# Pythpn_crash_course_answers
This repository is dedicated to the my work on the Python Crash Course (3rd edition) book written by Eric Matthes. All of the works that is being shared here is the explained examples and the answer of the assignment from the book.
I am learning python since 2022 with this book and attending on in cources in Coursera. The resaon I did this is because I wanted to help to people who wants to learn python by reading this book and make their life easier by just add the examples from the book and answers of the assignment that I wrote.
