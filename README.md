# Python_crash_course_answers
This repository is dedicated to my work on the Python Crash Course (3rd edition) book written by Eric Matthes. All the works shared here are explained examples and the answers to the assignments from the book.
I’ve been learning Python since 2022 with this book and attending courses on Coursera. The reason I created this repository is to help people who want to learn Python by reading this book and making their lives easier by simply adding the examples from the book and the answers to the assignments I wrote.
Please keep in mind that not everything is perfect. If you encounter any issues with the folders or files, please email me and let me know. I’ll fix it as soon as possible.
